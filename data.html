  This workbook contains time series of the major items of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position of 95 countries, 
  at annual frequency. The starting year varies by country. The first sheet, "boo-iif template," maps the conventional presentation of 
  the BOP and the IIF onto variable codes, using Australia as an example. The second sheet, "list of all BOP-IIF variables," lists all 
  the variables in the IMF's BOP/IIF database, with a variable code and a description. 
  The original source is the IMF's BOP database: http://data.imf.org/BOP. 
  This version: 9/23/2019.
