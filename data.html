	<p>
  <small>This workbook contains time series of the major items of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position of 95 countries. 
  The starting date varies by country. For the annual data, the earliest starting year is 1960, while for the quarterly data the earliest 
  starting date is 1989:Q1. The first sheet, "boo-iip template," maps the conventional presentation of the BOP and the IIP onto 
  variable codes, using Australia as an example. The second sheet, "list of all BOP-IIP variables," lists all the variables in the IMF's 
  BOP/IIP database, with a description. The original source is the IMF's BOP database:
