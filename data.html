  This workbook contains time series of the major items of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position of 95 countries, 
  at annual frequency. The starting year varies by country. The first sheet, "boo-iip template," maps the conventional presentation of 
  the BOP and the IIP onto variable codes, using Australia as an example. The second sheet, "list of all BOP-IIP variables," lists all 
  the variables in the IMF's BOP/IIP database, with a variable code and a description. 
  The original source is the IMF's BOP database: http://data.imf.org/BOP. 
  This version: 9/23/2019.
