		<b><font color="red">Long-run equity risk premium</font></b>
	<p>
		Estimate the long-run equity risk premium (LERP), by projecting 10-year-forward returns on (a) the internal rate of 
    return from cash flow discount models, i.e. CFDMs, and (b) yield ratios (P/E, dividend, CAPE, etc.), i.e. time-series
    models (TSMs). For the U.S. I show that CFDMs are no more reliable than TSMs. This puts CFDMs at a clear disadvantage 
    to TSMs, because CFDMs need a lot more inputs. A second takeaway is that model combination improves out-of-sample forecast 
    accuracy. Given these findings, I estimate the LERP using time-series models and their combination for several countries 
    and regions.

		<b><font color="red">Inflation uncertainty from surveys</font></b>
	<p>
		Some surveys ask respondents to provide probabilities for ranges of economic outcomes, including inflation. These density
    forecasts can be used to assess the respondent's (subjective) uncertainty, for example by fitting a parametric density function 
    to the discrete support for outcomes, and then calculating a dispersion measure for that function. The uncertainty measure, 
    however, is highly correlated across variables, e.g. growth and inflation, raising the question of how much of the estimated 
    inflation uncertainty is really about inflation, and how much is common uncertainty.

    devised a method to estimate the term premium that is both fast and only requires zero-coupon yields as inputs. Despite the 
    relative ease with which one could estimate international term premia, to my knowledge there is no live repository of such estimates, 
    which is the main output of this project. I also explore the extent to which the U.S. drives the international co-movement 
    of term premia and risk-neutral rates.
