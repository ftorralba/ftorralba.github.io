		<b><font color="red">Sovereign bond yields: determinants and estimates</font></b>
	<p>
		I estimate the long-run, fundamentals-based "fair value" of sovereign bond yields (and emerging markets' sovereign
		spreads) using a reduced-form econometric model. Acknowledging specification uncertainty, I produce a range of estimates of 
		the fair value yield or spread of each country, and then I combine them using Bayesian Information Criteria weights that
		approximate Bayesian Model Averaging.

		<b><font color="red">Crisis risk and asset returns</font></b>
	<p>
		A vast literature has explored the determinants of macroeconomic crises (banking crises; currency 
		crises/crashes; sovereign debt crises; and sudden stops/balance-of-payment crises), and estimated their probability. A 
		few studies have also characterized the behavior of asset returns before or during those crisis. In this project I 
		connect the estimated vulnerability to crisis, based on a country's fundamentals, and the performance of
		that country's asset returns. The hypothesis is that risk premia increase with the estimated vulnerability to crises.

		<b><font color="red">Regime-conditional asset returns and optimal porftolios</font></b>
	<p>
		The lore of portfolio management is full of stories about how certain asset classes over-/under-perform under 
		particular macroeconomic or financial conditions. Stocks, say, are particularly sensitive to growth, whereas
		long-term bonds respond more to inflation. For this project I collect or construct a list of binary regimes, each of 
		which is defined in reference to a macroeconomic or financial variable. For example: recession/no recession; rising/not 
		rising monetary policy rates; high/normal corporate rate spreads; etc. Some regimes are country-specific while others 
		are common to all countries. Then I characterize the regime-conditional first and second moments of asset returns,
		and study the behavior of those returns immediately before and after a regime switch. Finally, I construct 
		regime-conditional optimal portfolios, characterize those portfolios, and assess for what regimes the portfolios are 
		significantly different from the unconditionally optimal porftolios. Overall, at the end of this project I should be 
		able to answer the questions: (1) Which regimes are relevant, and which ones aren't? and (2) What does the optimal 
		portfolio look like for  each of the relevant regimes?
