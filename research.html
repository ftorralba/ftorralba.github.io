		<b>Sovereign bond yields: determinants and estimates</b>
	<p>
		I estimate the long-run, fundamentals-based "fair value" of sovereign bond yields (and emerging markets' sovereign
		spreads) using a reduced-form econometric model. The model takes into account the presence of (1) long-run and short-run
		dynamics; (2) domestic and global determinants; (3) unobserved common correlated effects; (4) fixed effects; and 
		(5) non-linear and cross-term effects. Acknowledging specification uncertainty, I produce a range of estimates of 
		the fair value yield or spread of each country, and then I combine them using Bayesian Information Criteria weights that
		approximate Bayesian Model Averaging.
		
		<b>Crisis risk and asset returns</b>
	<p>
		A vast literature has explored the determinants of macroeconomic crises (banking crises; currency 
		crises/crashes; sovereign debt crises; and sudden stops/balance-of-payment crises), and estimated their probability. A 
		few studies have also characterized the behavior of asset returns before or during those crisis. In this project I 
		connect the estimated vulnerability to crisis of a country, based on its fundamentals, and the performance of
		that country's asset returns. The hypothesis is that risk premia increase with the estimated vulnerability to crises.

		<b>Regime-conditional asset returns and optimal porftolios</b>
	<p>
		The lore of portfolio management is full of stories about how certain asset classes over-/under-perform under 
		particular macroeconomic or financial conditions. Stocks, say, are particularly sensitive to growth, whereas
		long-term bonds respond more to inflation. For this project I construct a series of binary regimes, each of which
		is defined in reference to a macroeconomic or financial variable. For example: recession/no recession; rising/not rising
		monetary policy rates; high/normal corporate rate spreads; etc. Some regimes are country-specific while others are
		common to all countries. Then I characterize the first and second moments of the main asset classes under each regime,
		and study the behavior of their returns immediately before and after a regime switch. Finally, I construct optimal
		portfolios under each regime, characterize those portfolios, and assess for what regimes the portfolios are significantly
		different. Overall, at the end of this project I should be able to give answers to the questions: (1) Which macroeconomic 
		and financial regimes are (have been) relevant? and (2) What does the optimal portfolio look like for each of those
		relevant regimes?
